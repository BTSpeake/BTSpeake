## About Me

Hi! I'm a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in theoretical and computational chemistry at the University of Nottingham. I carried out my PhD at the University of Nottingham under
Prof. Andrew M. Teale, where I became an active developer of the Quest electronic structure package. I implemented a novel version of the Embedded Fragment Method for 
molecular clusters for use within an external magnetic field, making efficient use of MPI based parallel programming. In conjunction with my work with the Quest software package, 
I have developed a molecular viewer user interface to be used independent of or directly with Quest. 
Both projects are currently unreleased but can be showcased through my published work (papers/thesis).

## Coding Experience
I have 5+ years experience with backend python development for efficient mathematical modelling and data processing using packages such as numpy/scipy/matplotlib/mpi4py. 
I have recently expanded in to front end GUI development, primarily in python using Qt in combination with OpenGL. 
Additionally, I also have experience with both C++ and HTML, which I am actively learning and expanding upon. 


## GitHub Projects 
At present, most of my projects you will find here are projects developed as tasks submitted for the Software Engineering bootcamp from HyperionDev, for which I was
sponsored by the UK Department of Education. Some projects have been further adapted to improve my general programming skills.
